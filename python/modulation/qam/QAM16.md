ðŸ§± 16-QAM Modulator (Gray-coded)

ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Mapping 4 Bits â†’ One Complex Symbol

### what we have in code:

	â€¢	QPSK modulator with Gray coding
	â€¢	16-QAM modulator with normalized power
	â€¢	Constellation plotting for both

add White Gaussian Noise (WGN) to your 16-QAM signal so you can simulate a noisy communication channel â€” 
and then visualize how the constellation gets corrupted with increasing noise levels.

âœ… Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) Channel

Weâ€™ll use the following model:

y = x + n

Where:
	â€¢	x is the transmitted QAM symbol.
	â€¢	n is complex Gaussian noise: n = n_I + j \cdot n_Q
	â€¢	The noise power is related to the desired Eb/N0 (energy per bit to noise power spectral density).

âœ… Expected Visuals
	â€¢	20 dB SNR: Symbols still tightly clustered â€” small cloud around each constellation point.
	â€¢	10 dB: More spread, but still separable.
	â€¢	5 dB: Clear overlap begins, risk of symbol error.
