ðŸ“¡ What is BPSK (Binary Phase Shift Keying)?
	â€¢	Modulation: Transmits bits as phase changes (0 â†’ 0Â°, 1 â†’ 180Â°)
	â€¢	Mapping:
	â€¢	Bit 0 â†’ +1 (cos(Ï‰t))
	â€¢	Bit 1 â†’ -1 (cos(Ï‰t + Ï€) = -cos(Ï‰t))

ðŸ”Ž Output:

Youâ€™ll see:
	â€¢	A modulated carrier with Â±cos(Ï‰t) flips depending on bits.
	â€¢	Recovered bitstream from coherent demodulation.
	â€¢	Zero or few bit errors (if no noise added).

ðŸ’¡ What is a Constellation Diagram?

A plot of complex symbols (I/Q values) transmitted or received. For BPSK:
	â€¢	Bit 0 â†’ +1 (real axis)
	â€¢	Bit 1 â†’ -1 (real axis)

So BPSK lives only on the real axis, but plotting helps:
	â€¢	Debug modulation/demod
	â€¢	Visualize channel noise
	â€¢	Validate symbol timing
