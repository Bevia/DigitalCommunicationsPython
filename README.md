# 🛰️ Digital Modulation Toolkit

A Python-based toolkit to simulate, visualize, and analyze digital modulation schemes. Ideal for signal processing learners, engineers, and researchers.

> Supports QPSK, 16-QAM, AWGN channel modeling, BER analysis, and constellation visualization. More schemes like 32-QAM, 128-QAM, and OFDM coming soon!

## 📡 Features

- ✅ **QPSK** Modulation/Demodulation
- ✅ **16-QAM** with Constellation Mapping
- ✅ **AWGN Simulation** with configurable SNR
- ✅ **BER Calculation** across SNR range
- ✅ **Constellation Plots** (ideal, noisy, rotated)
- 🚧 **OFDM** (Coming soon)
- 🚧 **32-QAM, 64-QAM, 128-QAM** Support (Planned)

🎯 Roadmap
